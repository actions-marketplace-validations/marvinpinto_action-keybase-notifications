## Using the Action

You will need a Keybase paperkey and its corresponding username. It is probably a good idea to create a dedicated Keybase account for this purpose, or at the very least generate a dedicated paperkey on your existing account. This makes it easier to revoke if needed.

### Pull Request Notifications Example

```yaml
name: "keybase"

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - "opened"
      - "closed"
      - "reopened"
      - "synchronize"

jobs:
  keybase:
    runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"
    steps:
      - uses: "marvinpinto/actions-keybase-notifications@latest"
        with:
          keybase_username: "${{ secrets.KeybaseUsername }}"
          keybase_paper_key: "${{ secrets.KeybasePaperKey }}" # "fancy regular ..."
          keybase_team_name: "${{ secrets.KeybaseTeamName }}" # "keybasefriends"
          keybase_topic_name: "${{ secrets.KeybaseTopicName }}" # "general"
```

          keybase_paper_key: "${{ secrets.KeybasePaperKey }}" # "fancy regular ..."

## Supported GitHub Events

The following events are supported in this action. Everything else gets silently ignored. Have a read through the [Events that trigger workflows](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows) document for more information on how this works.

```yaml
on:
  watch: # when someone stars a repository
    types:
      - "started"
  push: # when someone pushes to a repository branch
  pull_request:
    types:
      - "opened"
      - "closed"
      - "reopened"
      - "synchronize"
  commit_comment:
  issues:
    types:
      - "opened"
      - "edited"
      - "closed"
      - "reopened"
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - "created"
      - "edited"
      - "deleted"
```

## Filtering Notifications

You can cut down on chat noise by applying filters to events that trigger this action. For example, you can send a Keybase chat notification only when someone pushes to the `master` branch.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
```

Read through the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) for advanced examples.

## Versioning

Every commit that lands on master for this project triggers an automatic build as well as a tagged release called `latest`. If you don't wish to live on the bleeding edge you may use a stable release instead. See [releases](/releases) for the available versions.

```yaml
- uses: "marvinpinto/actions-keybase-notifications@<VERSION>"
```
